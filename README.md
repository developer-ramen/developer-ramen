# Hi there! 👋

I'm Viet, but you can call me Ramen just because I said so.

I'm from Vietnam 🇻🇳 *(oh hey my name's in there!)*, and I **love** coding and cracking problems in TypeScript and Rust (yes I am one of those hippie devs that jump on every new thing). My pronouns are he/him or they/them.

## What am I working on? 🏃

Well, *things.*

See, I'm very forgetful - you may have to remind me to update this every once in a while. Hey, that should be a GitHub feature!

### [Sentinel](https://github.com/out-post/sentinel)

It's a bot that I'm spending precious time trying to painstakingly migrate from TypeScript to Rust! Damn you, new language hype!

Check the bot out sometime! I have lots of features planned for it.

### [developer-ramen.github.io](developer-ramen.github.io)

What the - a personal blog? How unpredictable!

## Q&A

### Do I ~~sound this patronising and put on a friendly facade~~ speak like this in real life?

No of course not.

### *Fudge*, marry, kill: Language A, language B, language C.

Is Rust one of the options?

### What else do I like, other than obviously coding?

Pokémon, food, music, memes, fanfiction, and starting things that sounded really good in my head but then turned out to be more work than I am willing to put in!

### Can I please have your credit card details?

I don't think I even have one.

### Do I advocate for open source?

When you go through my computer and, heaven forbid, you find me using WebStorm or CLion, believe me when I say I got an educational license for that.

### Have I overshared and should I stop this section right here?

Probably.

## Reach out!

Take a look in my profile (which you probably are looking at right now, but whatever)!

Usually for these sections I would suggest you `Buy me a coffee!`, but I have bad experiences with caffeine... so `Buy me a pizza!` instead?
